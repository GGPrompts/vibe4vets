Title, description, eligibility, how_to_apply (application process)\n   - Website, phone, hours (contact information)\n   - Categories, subcategories, tags (classification)\n   - Scope, states (geographic availability)\n   - Cost (free or participant fees)\n   - Source tracking (organization/source tier)\n\n4. **Connector Opportunity:** These volunteer organizations could be candidates for new connector implementations similar to existing connectors (e.g., `backend/connectors/veteran_employers.py`)\n\n5. **Trust Tier Classification:**\n   - **Tier 1:** VA Voluntary Service (federal), Team Rubicon, Honor Flight Network (established national programs)\n   - **Tier 2:** American Legion, VFW, DAV, American Corporate Partners (established VSOs)\n   - **Tier 3:** The Mission Continues, Veterati (national nonprofits/platforms)\n\n---\n\n## Key Research Findings\n\n\u2713 **Seven Major Volunteer Pathways Identified** ranging from disaster response to career mentoring  \n\u2713 **Accessibility Options:** Programs from high-physical-demand (Honor Flight guardians) to flexible remote (Veterati, ACP)  \n\u2713 **Time Flexibility:** Options from single-day commitments to ongoing monthly volunteering  \n\u2713 **Cost Range:** Most free for volunteers; some programs (Honor Flight) require guardian fees  \n\u2713 **Geographic Coverage:** National programs with local chapters (40+ cities for The Mission Continues)  \n\u2713 **Skills Utilization:** Programs leverage both professional skills and life experience  \n\u2713 **Community Impact:** From 1+ million volunteer hours annually (VA/Legion/VFW) to 3.5M+ hours (all VA volunteers combined)\n\nSources:\n- [Team Rubicon -
