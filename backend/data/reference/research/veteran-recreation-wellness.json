IMPLEMENTATION NOTES FOR VIBE4VETS\n\n1. **Data Structure**: These programs typically require:\n   - Multiple locations (national headquarters + regional chapters)\n   - Specialized fields for program type, eligibility, adaptive accommodations\n   - Link to clinical effectiveness data (especially for animal therapy, creative arts)\n\n2. **Connector Strategy**:\n   - Create curated reference files for established organizations\n   - Partner with VA Sports Programs for Warrior Games and Golden Age Games data\n   - Use 211 data for local recreation programs\n   - API integration with organizations offering programmatic data\n\n3. **Search Prioritization**:\n   - Veterans with disabilities need adaptive sports highlighted\n   - PTSD-focused searches should return animal therapy and creative arts programs\n   - Wellness searches should include peer fitness communities\n\n4. **Eligibility Filtering**:\n   - Many programs target specific populations (post-9/11, disabled Veterans, PTSD)\n   - Some have geographic restrictions (regional vs. national)\n   - Cost varies significantly (free to several thousand dollars)\n\n---"
