Based on my exploration of the Vibe4Vets codebase and web research, here is my complete findings:\n\n---\n\n## Comprehensive Research: Education Benefits for Veterans Beyond the GI Bill\n\nI've completed extensive research on Veteran education benefits beyond the GI Bill, identifying opportunities to expand the Vibe4Vets database. Here's what I found:\n\n### 1. VR&E (Veteran Readiness & Employment - Chapter 31)\n\n**Program Name:** Veteran Readiness and Employment (Chapter 31)\n\n**Eligibility:**\n- Service-connected disability (20% or greater rating) required\n- Must have an employment handicap\n- For pre-2013 discharge: within 12-year basic period of eligibility\n- For post-January 1, 2013 discharge: no time limit on eligibility\n- Cannot already be working in a suitable job\n\n**What's Covered:**\n- Comprehensive rehabilitation services planning\n- Educational or vocational training (tuition, fees, books, supplies fully paid)\n- Subsistence allowance: $3,439.23/month maximum (2026 rates, tax-free, on top of VA disability compensation)\n- Option to receive GI Bill rate instead of Chapter 31 rate (often higher)\n- Supportive services and assistive devices\n- Job placement and career counseling\n\n**Eligibility vs GI Bill:** VR&E is **NOT** a benefit you \"use up\" like GI Bill. It's a service program specifically for those with service-connected disabilities. You don't need GI Bill benefits to qualify. Can be used in conjunction with or separately from GI Bill.\n\n**How to Apply:**\n- Apply online at VA.gov (recommended)\n- Use VA Form 28-1900\n- Sign in with Login.gov, ID.me, or DS Logon\n- In-person at VA regional offices\n\n**Website:** https://www.va.gov/careers-employment/vocational-rehabilitation/\n\n---\n\n### 2. Yellow Ribbon Program\n\n**Program Name:** Yellow Ribbon Program (Post-9/11 GI Bill Supplement)\n\n**How It Works:**\n- Participating schools voluntarily contribute funds to cover tuition exceeding GI Bill maximum caps\n- VA matches the school's contribution dollar-for-dollar (up to 50% of excess tuition)\n- School decides: contribution amount, number of participating slots, eligible programs\n- Works at private institutions, out-of-state public schools, foreign schools, graduate programs\n\n**Eligibility:**\n- Must be eligible for Post-9/11 GI Bill (100% eligibility required)\n- 36 months active duty (or breaks in service) + honorable discharge, OR\n- Purple Heart recipient on/after 9/11/2001 + any length honorable service, OR\n- 30 continuous days active duty on/after 9/11/2001 + service-connected discharge\n\n**Participating Schools:** 2,000+ domestic schools participate for 2025-2026 academic year\n\n**Finding Schools:**\n- VA Yellow Ribbon School Finder: https://www.va.gov/education/yellow-ribbon-participating-schools/\n- GI Bill Comparison Tool: https://www.va.gov/education/gi-bill-comparison-tool/\n\n**Website:** https://www.va.gov/education/about-gi-bill-benefits/post-9-11/yellow-ribbon-program/\n\n---\n\n### 3. State Education Benefits (Free/Reduced Tuition)\n\n**States with Free/Reduced Tuition Programs:**\n\n**Arizona:**\n- Purple Heart Tuition Waiver\n- Requirements: Resident veteran, 50%+ VA disability rating, Purple Heart recipient\n- Benefit: Tuition-free at public universities and community colleges\n\n**Connecticut:**\n- Tuition waivers at state universities and 12 community/technical colleges\n- VA benefits don't cover full tuition cost\n- State pays the difference\n\n**Florida:**\n- Purple Heart recipients: Free undergraduate tuition at state universities and community colleges\n- Requirement: Resident, received Purple Heart or combat decoration\n\n**Illinois:**\n- Illinois Veteran Grant Program\n- Benefit: Free tuition and select fee waivers at state colleges and universities\n\n**Montana:**\n- State Veteran Tuition Waiver\n- Requirements: Honorable discharge, Montana residency\n- For: Veterans with exhausted/expired VA education benefits\n\n**South Dakota:**\n- Various education programs (check South Dakota Department of Veterans Affairs)\n\n**Texas:**\n- Hazlewood Act\n- Benefit: Up to 150 hours tuition exemption including most fees\n- Eligible: Veterans, spouses, dependent children at public institutions\n\n**Virginia:**\n- Virginia Military Survivors & Dependents Education Program (VMSDEP)\n- Support for survivors and dependents\n\n**General Rule:** Veterans Choice Act provides in-state tuition rates even if not a resident, when covered under GI Bill or VR&E\n\n**Resource:** https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/free-tuition\n\n---\n\n### 4. Major Veteran Scholarships (Beyond GI Bill)\n\n**Already in Vibe4Vets Database (from veteran_scholarships.json):**\n- Pat Tillman Foundation Scholars ($10,000/year)\n- Folds of Honor ($5,000/term)\n- VFW Sport Clips Help A Hero ($5,000)\n- American Legion Legacy Scholarship ($20,000 renewable)\n- Edith Nourse Rogers STEM Scholarship ($30,000 extension)\n- DAV National Education Scholarships ($1,000-$5,000)\n- AMVETS National Scholarship ($1,000-$4,000)\n- Marine Corps Scholarship Foundation ($1,500-$10,000)\n- Army Women's Foundation Legacy ($1,000-$2,500)\n- Air Force Aid Society ($500-$5,000)\n- Navy-Marine Corps Relief Society ($3,000)\n- Coast Guard Foundation ($1,000-$5,000)\n- Fisher House Foundation ($2,000-$5,000)\n- Paralyzed Veterans of America ($1,000-$5,000)\n- MOAA Scholarship Fund ($2,500-$5,000)\n\n**High-Value Programs NOT Currently Listed:**\n- **Hiring Our Heroes Programs** - U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation\n  - CDL training scholarships (full-ride for 500 veterans)\n  - Veteran Career Training Program (VCTP) - no-cost for post-9/11 veterans, spouses\n  - Focus: Operations/project management, HR, IT certifications\n  - Website: https://www.uschamberfoundation.org/solutions/workforce-development-and-training/hiring-our-heroes\n\n- **Syracuse University IVMF Programs** - D'Aniello Institute for Veterans and Military Families\n  - Multiple career training and educational programs\n  - SU veteran student resources\n  - Research partnerships on military employment\n  - Website: https://ivmf.syracuse.edu/\n\n- **Troops to Teachers STEM** - Already in database but not highlighted\n  - Up to $10,000\n  - For Veterans becoming teachers\n  - Focus: High-need STEM subjects in underserved schools\n\n- **SkillBridge Higher Education** - Already in database but not highlighted\n  - Salary continuation during education/training\n  - For active duty within 180 days of separation\n  - Civilian job training + education during separation window\n\n---\n\n### 5. Aggregator Sites for Scholarship Search\n\n**Already Listed in Database:**\n- Military.com Scholarship Finder\n- Fastweb Military Scholarships\n- Student Veterans of America Resource Hub\n- VA Education Benefits Hub\n\n**Additional High-Quality Resources to Consider:**\n- Scholarships.com (veteran scholarships section)\n- Bold.org (23+ verified veteran scholarships)\n- ScholarshipsandGrants.us (2026 veteran scholarships)\n- Scholarships360 (52+ veteran scholarships)\n- Scholarship America (dedicated veteran scholarships)\n- ASU Veterans Resources (university-specific scholarships)\n\n---\n\n### 6. Key Gaps in Current Vibe4Vets Database\n\nBased on my analysis of the `/backend/data/reference/veteran_scholarships.json` file, here are recommendations for expansion:\n\n**Missing Program Categories:**\n1. State-specific tuition waivers (currently not in database)\n2. Hiring Our Heroes employment training programs with education components\n3. Corporate/employer-sponsored education programs\n4. University-specific veteran scholarships (many schools offer their own)\n5. Trade-specific education programs (CDL, electrical, plumbing certifications)\n\n**Existing Programs Needing Enhancement:**\n- VR&E needs dedicated resource entry (separate from scholarships)\n- Yellow Ribbon Program needs school lookup tool integration\n- State benefits need state-by-state breakdown\n\n**Connector Opportunities:**\n1. Create `veteran_education_benefits.py` connector for comprehensive education benefit resources\n2. Create `state_education_benefits.py` connector for state-specific programs\n3. Create `corporate_training_scholarships.py` connector for employer-sponsored programs\n4. Enhance existing `scholarships.py` to include more aggregator sites\n\n---\n\n### 7. Data Structure Recommendations\n\nFor expanding Vibe4Vets, I recommend these new data categories:\n\n**New Subcategory:** `education-vocational` under \"training\" category\n- VR&E programs\n- State vocational programs\n- Trade certifications\n\n**New Subcategory:** `military-education` under \"benefits\" category\n- State education benefit programs\n- Chapter-specific education benefits\n\n**Enhanced Tagging System:**\n- `vr-e` (Veteran Readiness & Employment)\n- `yellow-ribbon` (Yellow Ribbon participating schools)\n- `state-benefit` (State-specific programs)\n- `corporate-sponsored` (Employer-funded programs)\n- `trade-certification` (Non-degree certifications)\n\n---\n\n### 8. Current Vibe4Vets Strengths\n\nThe existing scholarship database is comprehensive and well-structured, including:\n- 20+ major scholarship programs with eligibility details\n- Pat Tillman and Folds of Honor (tier-1 programs)\n- Branch-specific scholarship focus (Marines, Army, Air Force, Navy, Coast Guard)\n- Family-focused scholarships (spouses, children, dependents)\n- Specialized programs (STEM, teaching, spinal cord injured)\n- Multiple aggregator sites for self-service searching\n\n---\n\n### Sources\n\n- [Veteran Readiness and Employment (Chapter 31) | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/careers-employment/vocational-rehabilitation/)\n- [Eligibility for Veteran Readiness and Employment | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/careers-employment/vocational-rehabilitation/eligibility/)\n- [Yellow Ribbon Program | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/education/about-gi-bill-benefits/post-9-11/yellow-ribbon-program/)\n- [States Offering Free Tuition to Veterans | Veterans Benefits Knowledge Base](https://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/free-tuition)\n- [In-state tuition rates under the Veterans Choice Act | Veterans Affairs](https://www.va.gov/resources/in-state-tuition-rates-under-the-veterans-choice-act/)\n- [Hiring Our Heroes | U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation](https://www.uschamberfoundation.org/solutions/workforce-development-and-training/hiring-our-heroes)\n- [D'Aniello Institute for Veterans and Military Families | Syracuse University](https://ivmf.syracuse.edu/)\n- [Veterans Scholarships (2026) | ScholarshipsandGrants.us](https://scholarshipsandgrants.us/list/veterans/)"
