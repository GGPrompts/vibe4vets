Add **National Call Center for Homeless Veterans** to mental_health_resources.json\n2. Document full Veterans Crisis Line workflow: dispatch options, what responder does\n3. Create dedicated \"Crisis Resources\" subcategory under Mental Health\n4. Add S.A.V.E. training information for families\n\n### Phase 2 (Near-term):\n1. Build connector for **SAMHSA crisis center database** by state\n2. Document **Mobile Vet Center availability** more explicitly (currently just a number)\n3. Add **suicide prevention education resources** (Warning signs, means safety)\n4. Create resource: \"What to do if worried about a Veteran\"\n\n### Phase 3 (Medium-term):\n1. Research and add **state-specific crisis hotlines** (especially states with high Veteran population)\n2. Build **mobile crisis team directory** (community mental health + law enforcement partnerships)\n3. Document **27-minute protocol** - what happens after Veterans Crisis Line connects with responder\n4. Add **substance abuse + crisis integration** pathways\n\n### Phase 4 (Long-term):\n1. Create **after-hours therapy availability map** - show which organizations have evening/weekend options by state\n2. Build **Veteran peer counselor directory** - who are trained peer responders near me?\n3. Document **postvention resources** - support after suicide loss in Veteran community\n4. Research **residential crisis stabilization units** specifically for Veterans\n\n---\n\n## KEY RESOURCE CONTACTS TO DOCUMENT\n\n| Resource | Phone | Hours | Type |\n|----------|-------|-------|------|\n| **Veterans Crisis Line** | 988 then 1 | 24/7 | Crisis intervention |\n| **National Call Center for Homeless Veterans** | 1-877-4US-VETS | 24/7 | Housing crisis |\n| **SAMHSA National Helpline** | 1-800-662-4357 | 24/7 | Substance use crisis |\n| **Vet Centers** | 1-877-927-8387 | 24/7 (call center); varied walk-in | Counseling/crisis |\n| **Stop Soldier Suicide** | 1-844-889-5610 | Business hours + VCL backup | Suicide prevention |\n| **Crisis Text Line** | Text HOME to 741741 | 24/7 | General crisis |\n| **988 Suicide Lifeline** | 988 | 24/7 | General suicide prevention |\n| **Emergency Services** | 911 | 24/7 | Immediate danger |\n\n---\n\n## DATA STRUCTURE RECOMMENDATION\n\nFor comprehensive crisis resources, recommend this JSON structure:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Resource Name\",\n  \"organization\": \"Org Name\",\n  \"service_type\": \"crisis-intervention|crisis-text|crisis-call|after-hours-therapy|peer-support|residential-program\",\n  \"contact\": {\n    \"phone\": \"X-XXX-XXX-XXXX\",\n    \"text\": \"XXXXX\",\n    \"chat_url\": \"https://...\",\n    \"website\": \"https://...\",\n    \"tty\": \"X-XXX-XXX-XXXX\"\n  },\n  \"availability\": {\n    \"hours\": \"24/7/365|varies-by-location\",\n    \"response_time\": \"< 9 seconds|varies\",\n    \"after_hours_options\": true|false\n  },\n  \"what_happens_when_you_call\": \"Detailed description of process\",\n  \"responder_dispatch_options\": [\"trained_vet_counselor\", \"mobile_crisis_team\", \"law_enforcement\", \"ems\"],\n  \"who_can_use\": \"All Veterans, Service Members, Families\",\n  \"cost\": \"free\",\n  \"eligibility\": {\n    \"veteran_era\": \"any|post-9/11|specific\",\n    \"discharge_status\": \"any|honorable|other\",\n    \"service_connection\": \"not required\"\n  },\n  \"crisis_types_handled\": [\"suicide\", \"ptsd\", \"substance-abuse\", \"homelessness\", \"mst\", \"relationship-crisis\"],\n  \"geographic_scope\": \"national|state|local\",\n  \"specializations\": [\"mst\", \"substance-abuse\", \"homeless-veterans\"]\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## SUMMARY TABLE: Crisis Resources Currently Documented\n\n| Resource | Type | Available | Phone | 24/7 | Documented in Vibe4Vets |\n|----------|------|-----------|-------|------|------------------------|\n| Veterans Crisis Line | Crisis call/text/chat | YES | 988+1 | YES | YES \u2713 |\n| Vet Centers | Counseling (walk-in + crisis) | YES | 1-877-927-8387 | YES (call center) | YES \u2713 |\n| Stop Soldier Suicide | Suicide prevention therapy | YES | 1-844-889-5610 | Partial | YES \u2713 |\n| The Headstrong Project | PTSD/Trauma therapy | YES | Online intake | Varies | YES \u2713 |\n| Cohen Veterans Network | Therapy | YES | Website | Varies | YES \u2713 |\n| National Call Center (Homeless) | Housing crisis | YES | 1-877-4US-VETS | YES | **NO \u2717 MISSING** |\n| SAMHSA Helpline | Substance crisis | YES | 1-800-662-4357 | YES | **NO \u2717 MISSING** |\n| 988 Lifeline | General suicide | YES | 988 | YES | **NO \u2717 MISSING** |\n| State crisis centers | Regional crisis | VARIES | State-specific | Varies | **NO \u2717 MISSING** |\n| Mobile crisis teams | Emergency intervention | VARIES | State-specific | Varies | **NO \u2717 MISSING** |\n\n---\n\nThis research identifies that Vibe4Vets has strong foundational crisis resources but needs to add homeless veteran crisis services and integrate broader 988 network resources to be truly comprehensive."
