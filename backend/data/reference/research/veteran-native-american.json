INTEGRATION PRIORITY MATRIX\n\n**Current Status in Vibe4Vets: ALREADY INTEGRATED**\n\n**HIGH PRIORITY - Already Implemented:**\n1. Urban Indian Organizations (UIOs) - 41 organizations integrated\n2. VA Tribal Health Programs - 4 programs integrated\n3. VA-IHS Clinic-in-a-Clinic - Arizona locations included\n\n**HIGH PRIORITY - Recommended for Integration:**\n1. **VA Tribal Organization Recognition Directory** - Official VA tribal VSO list\n2. **IHS/VA Native Veterans Map Spreadsheet** - Complete download integration\n3. **NAIV Regional Office Locations** - 14 regional offices\n4. **Tribal HUD-VASH Program Grantees** - By HUD ONAP region\n5. **VHA Office of Tribal Health** - National program hub\n\n**MEDIUM-HIGH PRIORITY:**\n1. TVR (Tribal Veterans Representative) Program locations\n2. National Tribal Housing Directory\n3. VA Veteran Readiness & Employment programs\n4. IHS Find Health Care Locator (tribal facilities)\n5. Apprenticeship opportunities for Native Veterans\n\n**MEDIUM PRIORITY:**\n1. State-by-state DVOP programs with tribal partnerships\n2. SSVF and Grant & Per Diem grantees\n3. Tribal Legal Aid programs\n4. State VSO and tribal VSO directories\n5. NACVSO member directory\n\n---\n\n### 11. POPULATION & COVERAGE STATISTICS\n\n- **Total Native American Veterans:** 140,000+ (per VA)\n- **Military Service Participation:** 25% of able-bodied adult Native Americans (vs. 3% general population)\n- **VA Facilities in Tribal Areas:** 1,500 locations\n- **IHS Urban Indian Organizations:** 41 organizations with 82 locations\n- **Trained Tribal Veterans Representatives:** 800+\n- **Tribal Governments Engaged:** 500+ in 30+ states\n- **VA Regional Areas with Tribal Focus:** 12 IHS regions\n\n---\n\n### 12. UNIQUE CONSIDERATIONS FOR NATIVE AMERICAN VETERANS\n\n1. **Trust Lands:** Many programs specifically designed for services on federally recognized tribal lands\n2. **Tribal Sovereignty:** Government-to-government relationships required for effective partnerships\n3. **Cultural Competency:** UIOs and tribal programs emphasize traditional healing alongside Western medicine\n4. **Geographic Challenges:** Rural and remote reservation locations require special outreach\n5. **Multiple Funding Sources:** IHS, VA, HUD, DOL, BIA coordination needed\n6. **Underutilization:** <50% of eligible Native Veterans claim benefits (needs outreach)\n7. **Healthcare Integration:** IHS-VA MOU allows concurrent access to both systems\n\n---\n\n### 13. KEY CONTACT POINTS FOR OUTREACH\n\n| Organization | Contact Method | Data Request |\n|---|---|---|\n| VA OTGR | TribalGovernmentConsultation@va.gov | Tribal org directory, TVR locations |\n| VHA Tribal Health | VHAOfficeofTribalHealth@va.gov | Health program info, clinic locations |\n| VA Tribal Health Docs | VHA Tribal Documentation, PO Box 5100, Janesville, WI 53547-5100 | Copay exemption documentation |\n| NAIV | https://naivets.org/ | Regional office locations |\n| IHS | Regional offices by state | Facility data, veteran programs |\n| HUD ONAP | By region | TDHE directory, HUD-VASH grantees |\n\n---\n\n### 14. KNOWN GAPS & RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n**Current Gaps:**\n1. No unified API for all tribal veteran services\n2. Scattered geographic employment program data (state-by-state variation)\n3. Limited public tribal-specific APIs\n4. Many directories require manual updates\n5. Underutilization documentation scattered across agencies\n\n**Recommendations for Vibe4Vets:**\n\n1. **Expand Tribal Veterans Connector**\n   - Add NAIV regional office locations\n   - Integrate VA Tribal Organization Recognition Directory\n   - Include Tribal HUD-VASH grantee data by region\n\n2. **Create DVOP Employment Connector**\n   - State-by-state mapping of programs with tribal partnerships\n   - Coordinate with Department of Labor regional offices\n\n3. **Develop Housing Programs Connector**\n   - Tribal HUD-VASH program locations\n   - SSVF grantees with Native American focus\n   - Grant & Per Diem tribal providers\n\n4. **Build TVR Locator**\n   - Parse VA's Tribal Veterans Representative directory\n   - Include training locations and schedules\n\n5. **Establish Direct Relationships**\n   - Data-sharing agreements with VA OTGR\n   - Tribal government partnerships for primary research\n\n---\n\n### 15.
