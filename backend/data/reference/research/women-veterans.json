  "raw_content": "Perfect! Now I have a comprehensive understanding of the codebase. Let me compile a detailed research report on Women Veterans resources:\n\n## Research Report: Women Veterans Resources\n\nBased on my exploration of the Vibe4Vets codebase, I've discovered that while the system has comprehensive connectors for general veteran resources, there is currently **no dedicated connector for Women Veterans resources**. Below is a detailed research document organized by the five categories you requested.\n\n---\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nThe Vibe4Vets database currently lacks specific Women Veterans resources across multiple critical areas. This represents a significant gap as Women Veterans comprise approximately 10% of the veteran population (2+ million) and face unique challenges including:\n- Gender-specific health needs (maternal care, gynecology)\n- Military Sexual Trauma (MST) support\n- Caregiving roles (childcare, family support)\n- Underrepresentation in traditional VSO networks\n- Career transition barriers unique to women service members\n\n**Recommended Integration Level**: Create a dedicated connector tier to centralize Women Veterans organizations and MST-specific resources across employment, housing, legal, healthcare, and family support categories.\n\n---\n\n## 1.

Create New Connector: `women_veterans.py`\n**Tier**: Mix of Tier 1 (VA official), Tier 2 (established nonprofits)\n**Focus**: Curated list of Women Veterans organizations covering:\n- VA Women's Health programs\n- Women Veterans organizations (WVI, SWAN, MVA)\n- Employment programs (Hiring Our Heroes women track)\n- Housing (Final Salute, HUD-VASH women focus)\n- MST-specific resources\n\n### 2. Enhance Existing Connectors\n- **`mental_health.py`**: Add specific MST crisis resources (RAINN, Veterans Crisis Line MST)\n- **`vet_centers.py`**: Tag locations that have women-specific services\n- Create new subcategory in taxonomy: `mst-support` under mentalHealth\n\n### 3. Update Taxonomy\n**Current**: Missing explicit women veterans category\n**Recommendation**: Add tags/subcategories:\n- `women-veterans` - as a special tag\n- `mst` (Military Sexual Trauma) - subcategory under mentalHealth\n- `women-specific-health` - subcategory under healthcare\n\n### 4. Data Model Additions\n**Consider adding to Resource model**:\n- `target_demographics: list[str]` (e.g., [\"women-veterans\", \"post-9/11\", \"dependents\"])\n- Better tagging in `tags` array for searchability\n\n### 5.
