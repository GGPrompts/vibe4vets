Vietnam Veterans of America (VVA)\n\n**Chapter Locator URL:**\n- [VVA Chapter Locator: https://vva.org/what-we-do/our-members/chapters/](https://vva.org/what-we-do/our-members/chapters/)\n- PA State Chapters: [https://www.vva-pa.org/pa-chapters](https://www.vva-pa.org/pa-chapters)\n\n**Nationwide Scale:**\n- **700+ chapters**\n- **90,000+ members**\n\n**Technical Infrastructure:**\n- Web-based chapter search interface\n- Zip code search capability\n- **No public API** identified\n\n**Data Access Options:**\n- Interactive chapter locator by zip code/state\n- No bulk export capability found\n\n**Data Sharing & Partnerships:**\n- General contact: [https://vva.org/contact/](https://vva.org/contact/)\n- Membership info: [https://vva.org/who-we-are/membership/](https://vva.org/who-we-are/membership/)\n\n---\n\n## Summary Table\n\n| Organization | Posts/Chapters | Locator | API? | CSV Export? | Contact Strategy |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| VFW | 5,500-9,000 | [vfw.org/find-a-post](https://www.vfw.org/find-a-post) | No | No | National HQ partnership |\n| American Legion | 12,000+ | [mylegion.org](https://mylegion.org/PersonifyEbusiness/Find-a-Post) | No | Limited | State departments + National |\n| DAV | 1,900+ | [locators.dav.org](https://locators.dav.org/ChapterUnitLocator) | No | No | Corporate partnership program |\n| AMVETS | 1,400+ | [amvets.org/find-a-post](https://www.amvets.org/find-a-post) | No | No | National HQ (877-726-8387) |\n| VVA | 700+ | [vva.org/chapters](https://vva.org/what-we-do/our-members/chapters/) | No | No | General contact form |\n\n---\n\n## Key Findings\n\n**Common Patterns:**\n1. **No public APIs** - All VSOs use web-only interfaces, not programmatic access\n2. **Google Maps integration** - Both VFW and DAV leverage Google Maps for location display\n3. **No bulk export** - CSV/JSON downloads not available through any VSO\n4. **Manual maintenance** - Posts/chapters maintain their own data\n5. **Data freshness** - No public commit dates or freshness indicators\n\n**Recommended Approach for Connector Development:**\n\n1. **Direct Partnership (Preferred)**\n   - Contact each VSO's national headquarters about data sharing arrangements\n   - Highlight mutual benefits: VSOs get improved resource discoverability\n   - DAV's stated goal to \"increase partnerships\" makes them promising\n   - Request quarterly data exports (even as JSON or spreadsheet)\n\n2. **Web Scraping (If Partnership Fails)**\n   - VFW and DAV: Need to handle JavaScript rendering (Selenium/Puppeteer)\n   - American Legion: Server-side rendering may be simpler\n   - Respects robots.txt and rate limiting\n   - Would need state-by-state implementation for some orgs\n\n3. **Data Enrichment Path**\n   - Use geocoding (Census API) to supplement locations\n   - Cross-reference with VA facilities data\n   - Calculate trust scores based on update frequency\n   - Mark data as \"user-contributed\" if freshness is unknown\n\n**Next Steps:**\n1. Draft partnership outreach to each VSO\n2. Request: quarterly data exports, contact info updates, meeting days/hours\n3. Propose: \"Partner Directory\" badge on Vibe4Vets for data providers\n4. Fallback: Implement web scraper with 2-week refresh cycle\n\n---\n\n**Sources:**\n- [VFW Find a Post](https://www.vfw.org/find-a-post)\n- [VFW Contact](https://www.vfw.org/contact-us)\n- [American Legion](https://www.legion.org/)\n- [American Legion Find a Post](https://mylegion.org/PersonifyEbusiness/Find-a-Post)\n- [DAV Chapter Locator](https://locators.dav.org/ChapterUnitLocator)\n- [DAV Corporate Partnership](https://www.dav.org/get-involved/corporate-partnership/)\n- [AMVETS Find a Post](https://www.amvets.org/find-a-post)\n- [VVA Chapter Locator](https://vva.org/what-we-do/our-members/chapters/)\n- [VFW Post Statistics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterans_of_Foreign_Wars)\n- [American Legion Statistics](https://www.legion.org/about/organization)\n- [DAV Statistics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disabled_American_Veterans)\n- [Congress VSO FAQ](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R46412)\n- [VA VSO Information](https://www.benefits.va.gov/vso/)\nagentId: a626dd9 (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)"
