The fixed header (`position: fixed; right: 0`) doesn't receive this padding, causing misalignment.\n\n## Attempted Solutions\n\n### 1. CSS scrollbar-gutter: stable\nAdded to html element - caused extra white space column on right side.\n\n### 2. CSS !important overrides on body\n```css\nbody {\n  padding-right: 0 !important;\n  margin-right: 0 !important;\n}\n```\nDidn't work - Radix uses inline styles which have higher specificity.\n\n### 3. overflow-y: scroll on html\nForces scrollbar to always show - caused extra white space.\n\n### 4. MutationObserver to reset body styles (ScrollLockFix component)\nCreated `frontend/src/components/scroll-lock-fix.tsx` that observes body style changes and resets padding/margin. This worked but when combined with removing the CSS hacks, the shift returned.\n\n## Current State\n- ScrollLockFix component exists but header still shifts\n- Need to either:\n  1. Keep some CSS hacks alongside the MutationObserver\n  2. Find a way to make the fixed header also respond to body padding\n  3. Disable Radix scroll lock entirely at component level\n  4. Use a different dropdown component that doesn't lock scroll\n\n## Files Involved\n- `frontend/src/components/scroll-lock-fix.tsx` - MutationObserver component\n- `frontend/src/components/search-bar.tsx` - Landing page search with Select dropdowns\n- `frontend/src/components/ui/select.tsx` - shadcn Select wrapper\n- `frontend/src/app/globals.css` - CSS overrides\n- `frontend/src/components/header.tsx` - Fixed header component\n\n## Reference\nUser mentioned \"react portal for dropdowns\" as a past solution - worth investigating if Radix Portal config can help.","notes":"Implemented scrollbar-compensation for fixed header by applying `padding-right: var(--removed-body-scroll-bar-size, 0px)` so Radix/RemoveScroll body scrollbar-gap no longer misaligns header.
