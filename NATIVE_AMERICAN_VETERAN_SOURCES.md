## 16. Known Limitations & Gaps

5. **Underutilization Documentation**: <50% of eligible AI/AN veterans claim benefits (data source: VA)
6. **Urban Indian Gaps**: Urban Indian organizations included in map but limited service details
7. **Data Verification Challenges**: TVR and TVSO information not centralized; requires tribal contact
8. **Housing Program Complexity**: SSVF, HUD-VASH, Grant & Per Diem grantees overlap; requires state-level mapping
