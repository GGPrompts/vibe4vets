## Implementation Strategy Summary

### Phase 1: Foundation (Immediate)

3. Negotiate data-sharing MOAs with Salvation Army and Catholic Charities national offices

### Phase 2: Data Collection (Weeks 4-12)
1. Build HMIS data importer (CSV to Vibe4Vets taxonomy)
2. Create web scraper for regional Salvation Army and VOA locations
3. Integrate NCHV database for validation and cross-reference
4. Map faith-based designation to taxonomy categories

### Phase 3: Expansion (Months 4-6)
1. Add secondary organizations (Convoy of Hope, Methodist Services)
2. Build state-level aggregation for distributed organizations
3. Implement faith-based filtering on frontend
4. Establish quarterly data refresh schedule
